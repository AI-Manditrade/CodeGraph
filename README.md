## üìã Overview

**CodeGraph Analyzer** is a powerful static analysis engine that transforms your codebase into a rich, queryable Neo4j graph database. It now supports **multiple programming languages and frameworks**, creating a comprehensive "digital twin" of your entire software ecosystem. This enables unprecedented code comprehension, visualization, and AI-driven development workflows across complex, multi-language projects.

## üåü What's New: Multi-Language Support

CodeGraph Analyzer now provides robust support for a wide spectrum of programming languages and frameworks:

### Programming Languages
- **TypeScript/JavaScript** - Full support for modern TS/JS features with ts-morph
- **Python** - Complete parsing via Python's native AST module
- **Java** - Advanced analysis using tree-sitter-java
- **C#** - Comprehensive parsing with tree-sitter-c-sharp
- **C/C++** - Detailed analysis of headers, includes, and implementation
- **Go** - Complete structure and package relationship mapping
- **SQL** - Table, view, and query analysis from SQL files
- **HTML/CSS** - Structure and style mapping

### Frameworks & Technologies
- **React/Preact** - Component hierarchies, JSX elements, prop mapping
- **Tailwind CSS** - Class usage and relationships
- **Supabase** - Database schema and API relationships
- **Deno** - Module, import, and runtime analysis

## üöÄ Key Features

- **Cross-Language Analysis**: Analyze relationships between different languages in the same project
- **Comprehensive Scanning**: Intelligently identifies supported file types across your entire project
- **Two-Pass Analysis**: First builds detailed ASTs for each file, then resolves complex cross-file relationships
- **Rich Element Identification**: Extracts files, directories, classes, interfaces, functions, methods, variables, parameters, type aliases, components, SQL tables, and more
- **Relationship Mapping**: Maps IMPORTS, EXPORTS, CALLS, EXTENDS, IMPLEMENTS, HAS_METHOD, RENDERS_ELEMENT, USES_COMPONENT, REFERENCES_TABLE, and many others
- **Neo4j Integration**: Creates a queryable knowledge graph with optimized schema management
- **MCP Integration**: Works seamlessly with Model Context Protocol for AI-powered codebase interaction

## üîç Why Multi-Language Support Matters

Modern software development rarely happens in a single language. The expanded language support in CodeGraph Analyzer addresses critical challenges:

- **Unified View**: See your entire tech stack as a coherent system instead of isolated silos
- **Cross-Language Dependencies**: Trace relationships between frontend and backend components (e.g., React components calling Python APIs)
- **Microservice Architecture**: Understand service boundaries and communication patterns across different languages
- **Multi-Team Collaboration**: Enable specialists in different languages to see how their code impacts the broader system
- **Legacy Integration**: Map connections between newer and older components written in different languages
- **Complete AI Context**: Give AI assistants holistic understanding of your entire codebase regardless of language

## üìà Visualize, Understand, and Talk to Your Entire Codebase

With CodeGraph Analyzer, you can:

- **Navigate Complex Systems**: Easily explore relationships across language boundaries
- **Perform Intelligent Refactoring**: Understand the full impact of changes across your tech stack
- **Onboard Developers Faster**: Help new team members grasp the architecture regardless of their language expertise
- **Empower AI Assistance**: Enable AI tools to understand your codebase at a deeper level
- **Document Automatically**: Generate architecture diagrams that span language boundaries
- **Ensure Architectural Compliance**: Verify cross-language dependencies adhere to your design principles

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation and Prerequisites

### Prerequisites
- **Neo4j Database**: Tested with Neo4j Desktop v5.26.4 (Community or Enterprise)
- **Neo4j Plugins** (Recommended):
  - APOC Core
  - Graph Data Science (GDS) Library
- **Node.js & npm**: Latest LTS version
- **Python 3**: For Python code analysis (accessible in your PATH)

### Installation Options

#### Option 1: Easiest Setup (Recommended)
1. **Download**: Get the pre-packaged zip file containing the analyzer and necessary configurations
   
   [üì¶ Download CodeGraph_Setup.zip](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1lc9qrupxXHaBzWlTFwcjClM8ygPsmH4Y/view?usp=sharing)

2. **Unzip**: Extract the contents to `C:\code\amcp\` (or your preferred location)
3. **Configure MCP**: Set up your MCP servers
4. **Start Neo4j**: Ensure your Neo4j instance is running
5. **Run Analysis**: Use the code-analyzer-mcp tool via your AI assistant

#### Option 2: Manual Setup (from GitHub)
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ChrisRoyse/CodeGraph.git amcp
   cd amcp
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Compile TypeScript**:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

4. **Configure Environment**: Create a `.env` file for Neo4j credentials
5. **Configure MCP**: Set up your MCP servers
6. **Start Neo4j**: Ensure your Neo4j instance is running
7. **Run Analysis**: Use the CLI directly or the code-analyzer-mcp tool

## üìä Usage (CLI)

```bash
# Navigate to the project directory
cd c:/code/amcp

# Run the analyzer (using compiled code in dist/)
# Replace <path/to/your/codebase> with the actual path
node dist/index.js analyze <path/to/your/codebase> [options]

# Example: Analyze a multi-language project with specific extensions
node dist/index.js analyze . -e .ts,.py,.java,.cs,.go,.sql,.jsx,.tsx --reset-db --update-schema

# Example: Analyze a different project, ignoring node_modules and dist
node dist/index.js analyze ../my-other-project --ignore "**/node_modules/**,**/dist/**"
```

### Options:
- `<directory>`: Required: Path to the directory to analyze
- `-e, --extensions <exts>`: Comma-separated file extensions (default now includes all supported languages)
- `-i, --ignore <patterns>`: Comma-separated glob patterns to ignore
- `--update-schema`: Force update Neo4j schema (constraints/indexes)
- `--reset-db`: WARNING: Deletes ALL data in the target Neo4j DB before analysis
- `--neo4j-url <url>`: Neo4j connection URL (overrides .env)
- `--neo4j-user <user>`: Neo4j username (overrides .env)
- `--neo4j-password <password>`: Neo4j password (overrides .env)
- `--neo4j-database <database>`: Neo4j database name (overrides .env)
- `-h, --help`: Display help information
- `-v, --version`: Display version information

## üîÆ Powering the Next Generation of AI-Assisted Development

The expanded language support in CodeGraph Analyzer enables entirely new possibilities for AI-assisted development:

- **Truly Context-Aware AI**: Instead of guessing, AI assistants can query the graph to understand exactly how components interact across language boundaries
- **Natural Language Queries**: Ask questions like "Show me all React components that fetch data from Python APIs" or "Find SQL queries that affect the user profile table"
- **Precise, Cross-Language Refactoring**: AI can confidently refactor code, knowing it has identified ALL relevant locations through graph traversal, even across language boundaries
- **Architectural Adherence**: AI can generate new code that aligns with existing patterns and structures by querying the graph for examples, regardless of implementation language

## üåê Future Roadmap

We're continuing to expand CodeGraph Analyzer's capabilities:

- **Additional Language Support**: Rust, Ruby, PHP, and more
- **Deeper Semantic Analysis**: Data flow analysis and taint tracking
- **Enhanced AI Integrations**: Advanced MCP tools for tasks like automated testing and security analysis
- **Rich Visualization Tools**: Interactive visual exploration of the code graph
